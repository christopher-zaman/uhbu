                A vampire facial, or Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy, harnesses the body's own healing mechanisms and cellular resources for skin rejuvenation, utilizing the plasma and platelets found in your blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platelets play a key role in healing by fostering cell renewal, boosting collagen formation, enhancing blood circulation, and diminishing inflammation. In this process, blood is drawn and processed in a centrifuge to enrich the plasma, which is then re-injected into the skin, encouraging the development of new collagen and diminishing aging signs.
